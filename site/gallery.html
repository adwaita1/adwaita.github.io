            <p>My first feature film. I am glad to let you know it has been selected for <b><font color='Coral'>'Seven Hills Film Festival, Hungary'</font></b> as well as selected by <b><font color='Coral '>NFAI in top 5 Asian Films. </font></b>
              <br/> I have played the role of a village girl who tries to console her brother in hard times, and tries to bridge gaps and differences between her parents and brother. 
              It was a wonderful experience shooting this film, and working with renowned actors such as Abhay Mahajan and especially earning my first payment as a professional actress. I was initially very nervous to face the camera for the first time 
              but my co-actors surely made it easy for me.</p>

              <p> Tendlya is a film based on fans of the cricket maestro Sachin Tendulkar, and is a tribute to the legend himself and most importantly to his innumerable fans 
                rooted in every corner of the world. Directed by passouts from FTII(Film and Telivision Institute of India) Nachiket waikar, filmed by Cinematographer Bala Sharma and produced by Sachin Jadhav. 
                I worked as a lead actress in this film. It was a tough time for me shooting this film, as I simultaneously 
                  had my engineering exams going on. I use to code whenever I found idle time between shooting the scenes.
                  It was really fun and one of the best experiences of my life. Looking forward towards its commercial release.

                <p>Mishmi is a play depicting a brother-sister relationship. It was performed in the theatre competition 
                  named 'Firodia Karandak'. Main aim of the competition is to provide platform for students to show their arstistic musings.
                  The competition has now evolved from just drama competition to one where elements such as sand art,sculptures,dance and radium art, etc are included.
                  <b><font color='Coral'>I performed live sand art at this competition. We the team of MIT,Pune University also won 3rd prize in Firodia Karandak.</font>

                <p>Pluto is a satirical emphasis on various events taking place in the society. It hasn't been limited to any particular system but extends from the most basic system(education) to prominent system(political).
                  It makes various bantering remarks on society and how profoundly social media restricts an individual from being a rationalist. 
                  I played multiple roles in this play such as a feminist and a teenage girl.  </p>

                The idea of this play was inspired from <font color='Coral'>'Belarus'</font> theatre production. The play commented on various social issues such as child trafficking,
                corruption, female infanticide, and LGBT rights. I have played multiple roles such as a victim of child trafficking and forced prostitution.
